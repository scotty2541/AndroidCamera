# AndroidCamera
Example of an AutoFocus issue in Android

The intention of this app is simply to read a PDF417 barcode.

When the initial app starts with MainActivity, the camera opens and autofocuses.
When the initial app starts witnh Main2Activity, and then the button is pushed to open MainActivity qwhere the camera is, the autofocuses never occurs.

The change is accomplished by simply altering the manifest file.
